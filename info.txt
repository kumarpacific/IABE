I'll build an offline bundle now: copy the built fat JAR, create run scripts and config templates, and zip everything into enterprise-app-offline.zip you can transfer behind the firewall. I'll run commands to create the bundle and show next steps.

Now I'll create an offline package directory, copy the fat jar and required resources (application.yml, README, sql, static, scripts), include a start script and instruction file, then zip it.

I created an offline bundle you can copy behind your firewall.

What I packaged

A runnable fat JAR:
enterprise-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Project resources needed at runtime:
resources/ (copy of src/main/resources: application.yml, templates, sql, static, etc.)
Docs:
README.md
ProjectDetails.md
Run helper:
bin/run.sh (executable wrapper that sets SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION to application.yml and runs the JAR)
Bundle location (on your machine)

enterprise-app-offline.zip
How to use the bundle behind the firewall

Transfer enterprise-app-offline.zip to the internal host (scp, USB, whatever your process is).
On the internal host, unzip:
Edit the configuration:
Edit application.yml to set your internal Oracle datasource, Azure AD may be unused inside firewall; either configure SSO to internal IdP or disable oauth for internal runs.
Run the app:
The script sets SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION to the bundled application.yml. You can set environment variables (APP_ENC_KEY_BASE64, ISD_SHARED_KEY) before running, or supply JVM options via JAVA_OPTS.
Notes and follow-ups

All dependencies are contained in the fat JAR produced by Maven, so no external internet access is needed at runtime.
If you need to build on the internal host (not just run), you must also transfer the Maven repo or pre-resolve dependencies (I can produce a maven-offline bundle / local .m2 mirror if required).
If you want a Docker image for air-gapped registries, I can produce a Dockerfile and build the image locally, then export docker save into a tar you can import behind the firewall.
I can also add a small systemd service unit or supervisord script for production runs.
Would you like:

A docker image tar (docker save) I can produce locally for you to import inside the firewall?
A .m2 offline mirror archive (if you need to build internally)?
